      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Customizable Standup Forms</strong><br />
          Build your own standup form with a visual form builder in board settings.
          Add, edit, remove, duplicate, and reorder fields to match your team's needs.
          Each field supports custom labels, placeholders, help text descriptions,
          and can be marked as required or optional. Reorder fields with drag-and-drop
          on desktop or arrow buttons on mobile. Changes apply immediately for all
          board members.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Improvements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Admin Role Protection for Settings</strong><br />
          Board settings including name, timezone, standup forms, and invitation
          management now require admin privileges to modify. This prevents accidental
          changes while keeping settings visible to all collaborators. Non-admin
          users see a clear info message and disabled controls.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Form Builder Dependencies</strong><br />
          Added motion/react (framer-motion) for smooth drag-and-drop interactions
          in the form builder.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bugfixes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Line Break Rendering</strong><br />
          Fixed markdown rendering to treat single line breaks as hard breaks. This
          improves the experience for users unfamiliar with markdown's double-space-newline
          syntax, making text formatting more intuitive and natural.
        </li>
      </ul>
