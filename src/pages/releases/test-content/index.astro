      <p>
        This is a hardcoded test page at <code>/releases/test-content</code> to diagnose
        AWS Amplify 404 issues with dynamic routes.
      </p>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Sample Feature One</strong><br />
          This is a sample feature description with typical release note formatting.
          It includes multiple sentences and demonstrates how content would appear
          in a real release page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sample Feature Two</strong><br />
          Another feature with detailed explanations about functionality and user
          experience improvements.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Improvements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance Enhancements</strong><br />
          Various performance improvements and optimizations to make the application
          faster and more responsive.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bugfixes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fixed Critical Issue</strong><br />
          Resolved a critical issue that was affecting user experience in certain
          scenarios.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Testing Purpose</h2>
      <p>This page helps diagnose the following scenarios:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If this page works on AWS Amplify, it proves that static pages under <code
            >/releases/*</code
          > work fine
        </li>
        <li>
          If this works but <code>/releases/0.9.0</code> doesn't, it confirms the
          issue is with dynamic route generation in <code>getStaticPaths()</code
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Compare behavior with <code>/releases/hello-world</code> which also exists
          as a static page
        </li>
      </ul>
    </Content>
  </body>
