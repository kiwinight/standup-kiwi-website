Hey there! I'm Alex, a developer who has spent the last few months building an open source standup tool called **Standup Kiwi**.

Today, I'm excited to introduce Standup Kiwi with its first public beta — a lightweight, open source tool designed specifically for async daily standups. It's still in the very earliest stages of beta, but I think it's already useful enough to try out. And it's completely free during this beta period.

## Why I built this

My previous team used to run our standup meetings and async updates using Jira boards — mostly just to keep a record. But honestly, **Jira felt way too heavy** for something as lightweight as a daily standup.

We switched to Slack for a while, but things quickly felt **too scattered and unstructured**. That's when I started wishing there was a simple, board-style tool designed **just for standups**.

So I decided to build it.

## How it works

1. **Create a board** — Set up a board for your team, project, or personal tracking. Takes seconds.

2. **Write your standup** — Share what you did yesterday, what you're planning today, and anything blocking progress. Simple markdown editor, no complicated forms.

3. **Browse standups** — Catch up on today's or past standups. Each update becomes a clean, organized card on the board.

4. **Repeat** — Use it async or alongside live meetings. Your standup history is always there to review and reflect.

## How I use it

I start each morning with Standup Kiwi, using my personal board. It's become my favorite way to kick off the day — just me, my coffee, and a quick reflection on my work.

Every morning, I take 5 minutes to write down what I did yesterday and plan what I'm doing today. For example, yesterday I might write "Fixed the API authentication bug that was blocking user login" and today "Tackling mobile responsive design for the dashboard." This simple habit has been a game-changer. It helps me:

- Clear my mind and start fresh
- Remember important tasks I might have forgotten
- Feel more organized and less stressed
- Track my progress over time

Once team boards are ready (coming soon!), I'm planning to roll this out to my open source group — and even at work. I genuinely think we could **replace our daily standup meetings**, or at least have a clearer, async-friendly view of **what everyone's working on**.

## Who it's for

Standup Kiwi works well for anyone who wants to stay organized and productive. Especially:

- **Solo workers** — developers, designers, writers who want to track daily progress
- **Remote teams** — especially those working across time zones
- **Groups and communities** — who want a lightweight way to stay in sync

If you've ever started your day wondering "what was I doing again?" or felt lost in endless chat threads — Standup Kiwi might be just what you need.

For me, it's become a simple routine: 5 minutes each morning leads to a clearer mind, better organization, and actually being able to see my progress over time.

## What makes it different

There are many tools out there for team updates, but Standup Kiwi takes a fresh approach:

- **Simple yet powerful**  
  Unlike Jira or other heavy tools, Standup Kiwi focuses purely on standups. Write in markdown, organize in boards, and find updates instantly.

- **Clean and focused**  
  Simple design with dark mode support. A dedicated space that helps you stay on track.

- **Open source and flexible**  
  See exactly how your data is handled. Host it yourself or use our hosted version — your choice.

## What's coming next

While Standup Kiwi is already helpful in its current form, we're working on some features that will make it even better:

- **Team boards** — Work together, stay in sync, and build better communication habits as a team
- **AI features** to save you time and effort:
  - Listen to audio summaries of team updates while you're on the go
  - Get helpful writing suggestions based on your past updates
  - Transform quick thoughts into clear, professional standup messages

We're just getting started, and your feedback will help shape what comes next!

## You might be wondering…

- **Is it free?**
  Yes, it's completely free right now. During the beta period, I'll be introducing paid plans alongside a free plan with limited usage. Self-hosting will remain free, and I'll ensure it's easy to self-host and migrate your data.

- **Can I use it with a team?**
  Not yet. Team boards are in progress.

- **Can I self-host it?**
  Yes. It's open source and will stay that way. There's no setup guide yet, but one is planned.

- **Does it work on mobile?**
  Yes, the web app is fully responsive and works well on mobile browsers. A native mobile app isn't available yet, but it's on the roadmap.

## Try it out

Since it's open source, I'd love your feedback. Found a bug? Have an idea? [Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/kiwinight/standup-kiwi) — or just drop a star to support the project.

I'm already using it every day — and I hope it helps you too.
