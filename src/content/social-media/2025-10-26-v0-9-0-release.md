Standup Kiwi v0.9.0 is out with customizable standup forms, admin role protection, and better line break rendering.

The big feature: a visual form builder that lets you customize your standup questions. Add, edit, remove, duplicate, and reorder fields with drag-and-drop. Each field supports custom labels, placeholders, descriptions, and required/optional settings. Changes apply immediately for all board members.

We've also added admin role protection for board settings. Only admins can modify name, timezone, standup forms, and invitation management, while keeping everything visible to the rest of the team.

Plus a small but important fix: single line breaks in standup responses now render properly, making text formatting more natural.
